:: Tested on Windows 7 and 10 only.

Following AutoHotKey script copies a selected/highlighted text. If nothing is selected in a line of text, then it will copy (or cut) the whole line of text.

And if a copy or cut attempt is made on picture/file/etc, it behaves as copy function usually does.

Place the file in windows start up, have autohotkey installed and run on window startup.

Influenced by how VS Code handles this feature.
